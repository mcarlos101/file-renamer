\x0a\x0aPreamble\x0a\x0a  Th\
e GNU General Pu\
blic License is \
a free, copyleft\
 license for sof\
tware and other \
kinds of works.\x0a\
\x0a  The licenses \
for most softwar\
e and other prac\
tical works are \
designed to take\
 away your freed\
om to share and \
change the works\
.  By contrast, \
the GNU General \
Public License i\
s intended to gu\
arantee your fre\
edom to share an\
d change all ver\
sions of a progr\
am--to make sure\
 it remains free\
 software for al\
l its users.  We\
, the Free Softw\
are Foundation, \
use the GNU Gene\
ral Public Licen\
se for most of o\
ur software; it \
applies also to \
any other work r\
eleased this way\
 by its authors.\
  You can apply \
it to your progr\
ams, too.\x0a\x0a  Whe\
n we speak of fr\
ee software, we \
are referring to\
 freedom, not pr\
ice.  Our Genera\
l Public License\
s are designed t\
o make sure that\
 you have the fr\
eedom to distrib\
ute copies of fr\
ee software (and\
 charge for them\
 if you wish), t\
hat you receive \
source code or c\
an get it if you\
 want it, that y\
ou can change th\
e software or us\
e pieces of it i\
n new free progr\
ams, and that yo\
u know you can d\
o these things.\x0a\
\x0a  To protect yo\
ur rights, we ne\
ed to prevent ot\
hers from denyin\
g you these righ\
ts or asking you\
 to surrender th\
e rights.  There\
fore, you have c\
ertain responsib\
ilities if you d\
istribute copies\
 of the software\
, or if you modi\
fy it: responsib\
ilities to respe\
ct the freedom o\
f others.\x0a\x0a  For\
 example, if you\
 distribute copi\
es of such a pro\
gram, whether gr\
atis or for a fe\
e, you must pass\
 on to the recip\
ients the same f\
reedoms that you\
 received.  You \
must make sure t\
hat they, too, r\
eceive or can ge\
t the source cod\
e.  And you must\
 show them these\
 terms so they k\
now their rights\
.\x0a\x0a  Developers \
that use the GNU\
 GPL protect you\
r rights with tw\
o steps:\x0a(1) ass\
ert copyright on\
 the software, a\
nd (2) offer you\
 this License gi\
ving you legal p\
ermission to cop\
y, distribute an\
d/or modify it.\x0a\
\x0a  For the devel\
opers' and autho\
rs' protection, \
the GPL clearly \
explains that th\
ere is no warran\
ty for this free\
 software.  For \
both users' and \
authors' sake, t\
he GPL requires \
that modified ve\
rsions be marked\
 as changed, so \
that their probl\
ems will not be \
attributed erron\
eously to author\
s of previous ve\
rsions.\x0a\x0a  Some \
devices are desi\
gned to deny use\
rs access to ins\
tall or run modi\
fied versions of\
 the software in\
side them, altho\
ugh the manufact\
urer can do so. \
 This is fundame\
ntally incompati\
ble with the aim\
 of protecting u\
sers' freedom to\
 change the soft\
ware.  The syste\
matic pattern of\
 such abuse occu\
rs in the area o\
f products for i\
ndividuals to us\
e, which is prec\
isely where it i\
s most unaccepta\
ble.  Therefore,\
 we have designe\
d this version o\
f the GPL to pro\
hibit the practi\
ce for those\x0apro\
ducts.  If such \
problems arise s\
ubstantially in \
other domains, w\
e stand ready to\
 extend this pro\
vision to those \
domains in futur\
e versions of th\
e GPL, as needed\
 to protect the \
freedom of users\
.\x0a\x0a  Finally, ev\
ery program is t\
hreatened consta\
ntly by software\
 patents. States\
 should not allo\
w patents to res\
trict developmen\
t and use of sof\
tware on general\
-purpose compute\
rs, but in those\
 that do, we wis\
h to avoid the s\
pecial danger th\
at patents appli\
ed to a free pro\
gram could make \
it effectively p\
roprietary.  To \
prevent this, th\
e GPL assures th\
at patents canno\
t be used to ren\
der the program \
non-free.\x0a\x0a  The\
 precise terms a\
nd conditions fo\
r copying, distr\
ibution and modi\
fication follow.\

nts\x22 may be indi\
viduals or organ\
izations.\x0a\x0a  To \
\x22modify\x22 a work \
means to copy fr\
om or adapt all \
or part of the w\
ork in a fashion\
 requiring copyr\
ight permission,\
 other than the \
making of an\x0aexa\
ct copy.  The re\
sulting work is \
called a \x22modifi\
ed version\x22 of t\
he earlier work \
or a work \x22based\
 on\x22 the earlier\
 work.\x0a\x0a  A \x22cov\
ered work\x22 means\
 either the unmo\
dified Program o\
r a work based o\
n the Program.\x0a\x0a\
  To \x22propagate\x22\
 a work means to\
 do anything wit\
h it that, witho\
ut permission, w\
ould make you di\
rectly or second\
arily liable for\
 infringement un\
der applicable c\
opyright law, ex\
cept executing i\

opagation includ\
es copying, dist\
ribution (with o\
r without modifi\
cation), making \
available to the\
 public, and in \
some countries o\
ther activities \
as well.\x0a\x0a  To \x22\
convey\x22 a work m\
eans any kind of\
 propagation tha\
t enables other \
parties to make \
or receive copie\
s.  Mere interac\
tion with a user\
 through a compu\
ter network, wit\
h no transfer of\
 a copy, is not \
conveying. \x0a\x0a  A\

plays \x22Appropria\
te Legal Notices\
\x22 to the extent \
that it includes\
 a convenient an\
d prominently vi\

an appropriate c\

 and (2) tells t\

mands or options\
, such as a menu\
, a prominent it\

\x0a\x0a  A \x22Standard \

 an interface th\

official standar\
d defined by a r\
ecognized standa\
rds body, or, in\
 the case of int\
erfaces specifie\
d for a particul\

 to implement a \
Standard Interfa\
ce for which an \
implementation i\
s available to t\
he public in sou\
rce code form.  \
A \x22Major Compone\
nt\x22, in this con\

 window system, \
and so on) of th\
e specific opera\
ting system (if \
any) on which th\
e executable wor\
k runs, or a com\

or an object cod\

 The \x22Correspond\

a work in object\
 code form means\
 all the source \
code needed to g\
enerate, install\
, and (for an ex\
ecutable work) r\
un the object co\
de and to modify\
 the work, inclu\
ding scripts to \
control those ac\
tivities.  Howev\
er, it does not \
include the work\
's System Librar\
ies, or general-\
purpose tools or\
 generally avail\
able free progra\
ms which are use\
d unmodified in \
performing those\
 activities but \
which are not pa\
rt of the work. \
 For example, Co\
rresponding Sour\
ce includes inte\
rface definition\
 files associate\
d with source fi\
les for the work\
, and the source\
 code for shared\
 libraries and d\
ynamically linke\
d subprograms th\

pecifically desi\
gned to require,\
 such as by inti\
mate data commun\
ication or contr\
ol flow between \
those subprogram\
s and other part\

  The Correspond\

not include anyt\
hing that users \
can regenerate a\
utomatically fro\
m other parts of\
 the Correspondi\
ng Source.\x0a\x0a  Th\
e Corresponding \
Source for a wor\

  a) The work mu\

st license the e\
ntire work, as a\
 whole, under th\
is License to an\
yone who comes i\

f a copy.  This \
License will the\
refore apply, al\
ong with any app\
licable section \
7 additional ter\
ms, to the whole\
 of the work, an\
d all its parts,\
 regardless of h\

se the work in a\
ny other way, bu\
t it does not in\
validate such pe\
rmission if you \
have separately \
received it.\x0a\x0a  \
  d) If the work\

 user interfaces\
, each must disp\

 it such as to f\

 Non-Source Form\

these ways:\x0a\x0a   \
 a) Convey the o\

to give anyone w\

 c) Convey indiv\

 through the sam\

sponding Source \
may be on a diff\
erent server (op\
erated by you or\

that supports eq\
uivalent copying\
 facilities, pro\
vided you mainta\

object code sayi\
ng where to find\
 the Correspondi\

rdless of what s\
erver hosts the \
Corresponding So\

 obligated to en\

available for as\
 long as needed \
to satisfy these\
 requirements.\x0a\x0a\
    e) Convey th\

 the continued f\
unctioning of th\

If you convey an\

But this require\

for example, the\

.\x0a\x0a  The require\

 if the copyrigh\

 this is the fir\

 cure the violat\

Required for Hav\

solely as a cons\

  Therefore, by \

\x0a  10. Automatic\

\x0a  An \x22entity tr\

eives whatever l\

 You may not imp\

nd you may not i\
nitiate litigati\

 the Program or \
any portion of i\
t.\x0a\x0a  11. Patent\

utor\x22 is a copyr\
ight holder who \
authorizes use u\
nder this Licens\

 or a work on wh\

\x22 are all patent\

its contributor \

not include clai\

 infringed only \
as a consequence\
 of further modi\
fication of the \

 includes the ri\

 Each contributo\

 such a patent l\
