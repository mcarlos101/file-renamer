Qt for Python

Qt for Python offers the official Python bindings for Qt, which enables you to use Python to write your Qt applications. The project has two main components:

    1. PySide6, so that you can use Qt6 APIs in your Python applications, and

    2. Shiboken6, a binding generator tool, which can be used to expose C++ projects to Python, and a Python module with some utility functions.

This project is available under the LGPLv3/GPLv3 and the Qt commercial license.
